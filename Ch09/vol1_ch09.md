# Chapter 9: Newtonâ€™s Laws of Dynamics

He shows how numerical integration can get us a long way.

Could be fun to do this with moderne tools from DifferentialEquations.jl (https://diffeq.sciml.ai/stable/)

* Try simulate the solar system based on table values of mass and distances.
  * Start with earth-sun.
  * Then Earth-sun-moon.
  * Then add planets.
* Can we infer masses, distances and starting conditions based on observations?
* How do FLOSS sky simulators work?
