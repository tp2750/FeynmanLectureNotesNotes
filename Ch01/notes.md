# Chapter 1: Atoms in motions.

Feynman is mostly qualitative in this chapter, but gives exact values of atom sizes and angles in water:

* Angle between hydrogen atoms in water: 105 deg 3 minutes
* Distance between center of hydrogen atom and center of oxygen atom in water: 0.957 Å

The images look rather crowded.
Here I try to estimate how they should look:

* What is the mean distance between molecules in liquid water?
* What is the mean distance between molecules in air (ideal gas)

## Average distance in water

* Molecular weight of water: 18 g/mol.
* Density of water: 1 g/cm^3
* 1 mol is 6E23 molecules

This gives $ 18* 6E23 = 10.8 E24 

$$ 18 g/mol / 1 g/cm³ = 18 cm³ / mol = 18 E-6 m³ / 6E23 molecules = 3E-29 m³ / molecule $$ 

If we have molecules separated by 1m in each dimension, we get a density of 1 / m³. So to get an estimate of the average distance between molecules, we take the cube root:

$$ (3 E-29 m)⁻³ = 3.1 E-10 m $$

So an average distance of 3 Å .

## Average distance in gas

The ideal gas equation says

$$ PV = nRT $$

where 

* P pressure: N/m²
* V volume: m³
* n number of molecules: mol
* R gas constant: 8.31 J/K/mol
* T absolute temperature: K

So in 1 m³ at 1 atm = 1E5 N/m² at 28C = 300K, we have

$$ n = 1E5 N/m² * 1 m³ / 300 K / (8.31 J/K/mol) = 40 mol = 2.4 E25 molecules $$

or 

$$ 1 m³ / 2.4E25 molecules = 4.14E-26 m³ per molecule $$

So by taking the cube root, we get an average distance of 

$$ (4.14E-26 m³)⁻³ = 3.46E-9 m = 35 Å $$

So the average distance between molecules goes up by more than a factor of 10 from 3Å in water to 35Å in air.

## Apples and atoms

He quotes: "if an apple is magnified to the size of the earth, then the atoms in the apple are approximately the size of the original apple."

* Earth diameter: 13E6 m
* Atom diameter: 1E-10 m

How large is the apple?

$$ 13E6 / a = a / 1E-10 => a² = 13E-4 => a = \sqrt(13E-4) = 0.036 m = 3.6 cm $$

So it is actually not a very big apple.


## Molarity of water

As we have 1E3 g/L of water, we get a molarity of pure water of 55.6 M

$$ 1E3 g/L / 18 g/mol = 55.6 mol/L = 55.6 M $$

### pH

The auto hydrolysis of water give as pH of 7, meaning a concentration of "H+" of 1E-7 M = 0.1 µM.

So there are 55.6E7 = 556E6 water molecules per "H+".
The population of Europe (EU) is about 450E6. So if people were water about 1 in Europe would auto-proteolyses.

On the other hand, at pH 3 = 1mM "H+", it is 1 out of 55E3, so more like 1 in a large city. But still quite rare.

# Thoughts on teaching

Students need an understanding of sizes and units.

Ask students to find and relate figures like

* Diameter of Earth (12_742 km = 1.3E7 m)
* Distance to Moon ( 384_400 km = 3.8E8 m = 30 times earth diameter)
* Distance to Sun ( 150E6 km = 1.5E11 m = 395 times distance to Moon)

Ask the students to each find 3 other examples and compute the relations.
